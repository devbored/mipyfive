*Work in Progress*

## TODO:
- Utilize nMigen as the HDL for the Core and SoC design (provides more flexibility)
- Design the main RISC-V RV32I Core
    - Explore extensions later?
- Design basic SoC-creation utility
- Provide optional modules (i.e. Vectored Interrupt Controller, interconnect bus, Debug HW, etc.)
- Testing via nMigen (both formal verification and unit testing)
